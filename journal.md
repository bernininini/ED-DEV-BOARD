# journal of ed dev board

### Aug 16th
>> 3.5 HRS
- Planning;
- Starting with the idea of creating a pcb for a dev board that minimize the wiring.
- Researching and defining the goal of 'minimize the wiring' and what microcontroller chip
- Nailing it down to keep everything minimal and decided to uses QWIIC and ESP32 S3 WROOM 1
- - > ESP32 S3 WROOM1; WIFI, Bluetooth, and supports a lot different communication protocols like I2C and UART
- - > QWIIC; Standard 4 pins communication, plug and play.
- Research on how to use QWIIC by reading data sheets

- Schematics; 
- Starting a BOM rough draft
- Finding parts that is not in kicad; QWIIC ports, USB-C's footprints
- Wiring...
